# Image Generation with Pre-trained Models

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of text-to-image generation using pre-trained models, specifically Stable Diffusion v1.5. The system generates high-quality images from textual descriptions using state-of-the-art AI models.

## Project Description
The implementation utilizes the Stable Diffusion model to transform text prompts into detailed images. It's built on the diffusers library and leverages GPU acceleration when available for efficient image generation.

## Features
- Text-to-image generation
- High-resolution output
- Configurable generation parameters
- GPU/CPU compatibility
- Image saving functionality
- Support for custom prompts

## Technical Implementation

### Model Details
- Uses RunwayML's Stable Diffusion v1.5
- Implements half-precision (float16) for efficient processing
- Supports both GPU and CPU inference
- Configurable inference steps and guidance scale

### Key Components
- **Model Pipeline**: Stable Diffusion pipeline for image generation
- **Device Management**: Automatic GPU/CPU detection
- **Parameter Control**: Adjustable inference and guidance parameters
- **Output Handling**: Image display and save capabilities

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch
- Diffusers library
- Transformers library
- CUDA-capable GPU (optional, but recommended)

## Installation
```bash
pip install diffusers transformers torch
```

## Usage
1. Import required libraries
2. Initialize the Stable Diffusion pipeline
3. Prepare text prompt
4. Generate and save image

## Generation Parameters
- `num_inference_steps`: Controls generation quality (default: 50)
- `guidance_scale`: Controls adherence to prompt (default: 7.5)
- Custom prompt input
- Adjustable image dimensions

## Example Output
The model can generate various types of images, including:
- Futuristic cityscapes
- Digital art
- Landscape compositions
- Abstract visualizations

## Future Improvements
- Integration of additional pre-trained models
- Enhanced prompt engineering capabilities
- User interface development
- Batch processing support
- Style transfer options

## Performance Notes
- GPU acceleration recommended for optimal performance
- Memory requirements vary based on image size
- Generation time depends on inference steps

## Limitations
- GPU memory constraints
- Generation time varies by hardware
- Output quality dependent on prompt clarity
- Model-specific limitations
